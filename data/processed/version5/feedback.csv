"For the above stated mission, ship ABC needs to be evaluated. This should include evaluating the capacity and capability of its MGRS firing. The target reliability for this evaluation is to be set at 0.9. The range, consistency and accuracy must be the other criteria to be focused on for this evaluation. Current operating status of the MGRS can be easily evaluated at the ship level using parameters - P 1, P 2, P 3. The risk score for the mission must not be more than 11/25. P4 and P5 parameters should be used for evaluating the risk score.",Mission,Not Applicable,Ship,Evaluate,Ship,Fleet,Immediate,Sea,Maintenance scheduling,Minimum risk,"Reliability,Risk score",Not Applicable
