"We have to evaluate ship ABC for this mission. We need to focus on its gun capabilities, considering aspects like capacity, reliability (with a target reliability of 0.9), and factors like range, consistency, and accuracy. To gauge the current status of the guns, we can use parameters P1, P2, and P3 at the ship level. Additionally, we must ensure that the risk score for the mission doesn't go over 11 out of 25, taking into account parameters P4 and P5.",Mission,Sortie,Ship,Evaluate,Ship,Fleet,Immediate,Sea,Missile firing,Minimum risk,"Reliability,Risk score",Not Applicable
