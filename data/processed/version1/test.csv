"Based on satellite images, we've detected an adversary ship at location K, approximately 300 miles northwest of its home base. Our response involves intercepting and investigating, with a readiness to use missiles if required. The mission is slated for the next 48 hours, necessitating the deployment of an apt vessel within the coming 24 hours. The selected ship should maintain a speed of 25 knots, equipped with operational propulsion systems. It must also guarantee an endurance of at least 7 days, encompassing essential supplies like rations, fuel, and a Reverse Osmosis (RO) plant for freshwater.
