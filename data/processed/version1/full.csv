The selected vessel must travel at a speed of 25 knots, equipped with operational propulsion and PGD systems, and have an endurance of at least 7 days (including provisions such as ration, fuel, and RO plant).",Mission,Humanitarian,Fleet,Select K out of N,Ship,Fleet,24 hours,K,Interrogation and interception,Minimum risk,"Capability,Speed,Endurance,Ration,Fuel,Spares availability","Ship class,Fleet availability"
"A hostile ship has been detected via satellite imagery, sailing at location K, approximately 300 miles northwest of our base. Intercepting and interrogating the vessel is paramount. In case of hostility, engagement with SSMs may be necessary. The mission's completion is required within the next 48 hours, prompting the fleet to deploy a suitable ship within the next 24 hours. The chosen vessel must operate at a speed of 25 knots, equipped with fully functional propulsion and PGD systems, and maintain an endurance of at least 7 days (including provisions such as ration, fuel, and RO plant).",Mission,Fleet,Fleet,Select K out of N,Ship,Fleet,24 hours,K,Interrogation and interception,Minimum risk,"Capability,Speed,Endurance,Ration,Fuel,Spares availability","Ship class,Fleet availability"
"According to satellite photos, there is an enemy ship 300 miles to the northwest of the own base at position K. It needs to be stopped and investigated. In the event that the enemy ship takes hostile action, this might need to be engaged with SSMs. The task must be completed within the next 48 hours. Within the following 24 hours, the navy needs to deploy the right ships for this task.  25 knots of speed (with propulsion and PGD systems available), and a minimum of 07 days of endurance (with fuel, ration, and a RO plant).",Mission,Support,Fleet,Select K out of N,Ship,Fleet,24 hours,K,Interrogation and interception,Minimum risk,"Capability,Speed,Endurance,Ration,Fuel,Spares availability","Ship class,Fleet availability"
