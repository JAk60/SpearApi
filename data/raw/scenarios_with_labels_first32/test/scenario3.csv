"As the mission enters the harbor phase, load balancing dictates the activation of only 2 auxiliary power units (APUs) for the next 20 hours to provide essential onboard power. One APU from the entry-level and one from the action station should be operational, emphasizing equilibrium and achieving a reliability threshold of 0.9 with a risk score not exceeding 7/18.",Mission,,Equipment,Select K out of N,Equipment,Ships,Immediate,Sea,Maintenance scheduling,Minimum risk,"Balancing loads,Reliability,Risk score","Working hours,Manpower availability"
"Transitioning to the entry-level phase, the mission requires only 2 ballast control systems to regulate the vessel's stability over the next 20 hours. Activating one system from the defense station and one from the harbor ensures stability and meets the reliability criterion of 0.9 with a risk score below 7/18.",Mission,,Equipment,Select K out of N,Equipment,Ships,Immediate,Sea,Maintenance scheduling,Minimum risk,"Balancing loads,Reliability,Risk score","Working hours,Manpower availability"
"As the mission progresses into the action station phase, only 2 anti-aircraft defense systems need to remain operational for the next 20 hours to safeguard against aerial threats. One system from the entry-level and one from the defense station should be activated to maintain readiness and achieve a reliability rating of 0.9 with a risk score not exceeding 7/18.",Mission,,Equipment,Select K out of N,Equipment,Ships,Immediate,Sea,Maintenance scheduling,Minimum risk,"Balancing loads,Reliability,Risk score","Working hours,Manpower availability"
"Proceeding to the defense station phase, load balancing necessitates the operation of only 2 mine countermeasure systems for the next 20 hours to ensure maritime security. Activating one system from the harbor and one from the action station prioritizes safety and meets the reliability target of 0.9 with a risk score under 7/18.",Mission,,Equipment,Select K out of N,Equipment,Ships,Immediate,Sea,Maintenance scheduling,Minimum risk,"Balancing loads,Reliability,Risk score","Working hours,Manpower availability"
"Transitioning into the action station phase, the mission requires only 2 anti-submarine warfare (ASW) suites to be operational for the next 20 hours to detect and counter submarine threats. Activating one suite from the entry-level and one from the defense station ensures comprehensive coverage and achieves a reliability threshold of 0.9 with a risk score not exceeding 7/18.",Mission,,Equipment,Select K out of N,Equipment,Ships,Immediate,Sea,Maintenance scheduling,Minimum risk,"Balancing loads,Reliability,Risk score","Working hours,Manpower availability"
"As the mission advances into the harbor phase, only 2 replenishment-at-sea (RAS) systems need to remain operational for the next 20 hours to facilitate refueling and resupply operations. One system from the action station and one from the entry-level should be activated to ensure uninterrupted logistics support and achieve a reliability rating of 0.9 with a risk score under 7/18.",Mission,,Equipment,Select K out of N,Equipment,Ships,Immediate,Sea,Maintenance scheduling,Minimum risk,"Balancing loads,Reliability,Risk score","Working hours,Manpower availability"
"Proceeding to the entry-level phase, load balancing mandates the operation of only 2 helicopter landing systems for the next 20 hours to facilitate helicopter operations.
