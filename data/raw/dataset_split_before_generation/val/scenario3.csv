"Proceeding to the cruising phase, load balancing mandates the operation of only 2 helicopter landing systems for the next 20 hours to facilitate helicopter operations. Activating one system from the bow and one from the stern ensures operational flexibility and meets the reliability target of 0.9 with a risk score not exceeding 7/18.",Mission,,Equipment,Select K out of N,Equipment,Ships,Immediate,Sea,Maintenance scheduling,Minimum risk,"Balancing loads,Reliability,Risk score","Working hours,Manpower availability"
"Transitioning into the cruising phase, the mission requires only 2 electronic warfare (EW) suites to be operational for the next 20 hours to detect and counter hostile electronic threats. Activating one suite from the fore and one from the aft ensures comprehensive electronic protection and achieves a reliability threshold of 0.9 with a risk score under 7/18.",Mission,,Equipment,Select K out of N,Equipment,Ships,Immediate,Sea,Maintenance scheduling,Minimum risk,"Balancing loads,Reliability,Risk score","Working hours,Manpower availability"
"Throughout the next 20 hours of the action station phase, only 2 propulsion systems need to remain operational to ensure maneuverability. It's imperative to activate one propulsion system from the entry-level and one from the defense station to maintain balance and achieve a reliability rating of 0.9 with a risk score not surpassing 7/18.",Mission,,Equipment,Select K out of N,Equipment,Ships,Immediate,Sea,Maintenance scheduling,Minimum risk,"Balancing loads,Reliability,Risk score","Working hours,Manpower availability"
"Transitioning into the defense station phase, the mission mandates the operation of only 2 water desalination plants for the next 20 hours to sustain freshwater supply. One desalination plant from the harbor and one from the action station must remain active, ensuring equitable distribution and meeting the reliability target of 0.9 with a risk score under 7/18.",Mission,,Equipment,Select K out of N,Equipment,Ships,Immediate,Sea,Maintenance scheduling,Minimum risk,"Balancing loads,Reliability,Risk score","Working hours,Manpower availability"
"As the mission enters the harbor phase, load balancing dictates the activation of only 2 auxiliary power units (APUs) for the next 20 hours to provide essential onboard power. One APU from the entry-level and one from the action station should be operational, emphasizing equilibrium and achieving a reliability threshold of 0.9 with a risk score not exceeding 7/18.",Mission,,Equipment,Select K out of N,Equipment,Ships,Immediate,Sea,Maintenance scheduling,Minimum risk,"Balancing loads,Reliability,Risk score","Working hours,Manpower availability"
"Transitioning to the entry-level phase, the mission requires only 2 ballast control systems to regulate the vessel's stability over the next 20 hours. Activating one system from the defense station and one from the harbor ensures stability and meets the reliability criterion of 0.9 with a risk score below 7/18.",Mission,,Equipment,Select K out of N,Equipment,Ships,Immediate,Sea,Maintenance scheduling,Minimum risk,"Balancing loads,Reliability,Risk score","Working hours,Manpower availability"
