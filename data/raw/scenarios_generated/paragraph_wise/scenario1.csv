"A hostile vessel was detected 210 miles north of the Nicobar Islands, and it is being sought to intercept and interrogate it. The mission may involve searching for concealed danger using underwater drones or gathering evidence on shipwreck sites. All that must be accomplished within 60 hours will require a suitable ship to be deployed in 15 hours. This requires at least 8 days of operation with provisions, fuel, oil, convoys, freighters, etc., as well as desalination capabilities due to cooperation with allied naval forces."
"They have located an enemy vessel some 200 nautical miles (210 mi) north of the Nicobar Islands and are attempting to intercept and interrogate it with potential use of underwater drones to find hidden threats. To complete the mission in under 60 hours, they need to deploy a suitable ship to maintain its speed at 24 knots for at least 8 days and provide provisions such that their ships can continue to operate for up to 7 days; as part of their plan also includes cooperation with naval partners who may assist with any necessary operational operations such as oil spillage from pipelines and air tunnels within the region."
"An enemy ship has been identified 210 miles north of the Nicobar Islands, and it needs to be intercepted and interrogated. The mission may require the use of underwater drones to detect hidden threats. A suitable ship must be present within 60 hours, with the vessel expected to operate at 24 knots and provide food, fuel und desalination facilities for no longer than 8 days. Cooperation with other naval partners in the region is essential as this could enhance the success of any action taken by the US."
"We are currently intercepting and interrogating an enemy ship that has been located 210 miles north of the Nicobar Islands. The mission may involve searching for hidden threats using underwater drones, and we require a suitable ship to be present in the next 15 hours. This requires achieving operational speed of 24 knots at its maximum speed while providing humanitarian supplies such as food oil convoys or vessels for short-term supply."
"This is 210 miles north of the Nicobar Islands where an enemy ship has been detected and interrogated. Undertaking: Within 60 hours, we need to have a suitable ship ready for deployment within the next 15hours to ensure it can continue operating with provisions, fuel and desalination capabilities, then work alongside or in conjunction with other naval forces to complete the necessary operations including embarkation on board vessels that are currently active around Madagascar (including any potential hidden threat poses by enemy ships)."
"The rival vessel has been located 100 miles north of the Nicobar Islands. A suitable ship must be launched within the next 12 hours to intercept and interrogate the vessel, potentially using underwater drones to detect hidden threats. The mission must take at least 40 hours from start to finish, and it must operate with provisions, fuel, desalination facilities, or refrigeration for 8 days. It was possible that cooperation with the regional naval powers could lead to success on any one of these vessels."
"A competing ship has been detected some 100 miles north of the Nicobar Islands. To intercept and interrogate this vessel, a suitable ship must be launched within the next 12 hours, potentially using underwater drones to detect hidden threats. The mission must take at least 40 hours from start to finish, and it must operate with provisions, fuel, desalination facilities, or refrigeration for 8 days. It was possible that cooperation with the regional naval powers could lead to success on any one of these ships."
"It has been discovered that the rival vessel is located 100 miles north of the Nicobar Islands. Within the next 12 hours, an appropriate ship must be deployed to intercept and interrogate the vessel, potentially using underwater drones to detect hidden threats. The mission must take at least 40 hours from start to finish, and it must operate with provisions such as oil or petrol, refrigeration, or desalination facilities for 8 days. It was possible that cooperation with the regional naval powers could result in success on any expedition."
"The contrasting vessel has been located at a distance of 100 miles north of the Nicobar Islands. A suitable ship must be launched within the next 12 hours to intercept and interrogate the vessel, potentially using underwater drones to locate concealed threats. The mission must take at least 40 hours from start to finish, and it must operate with provisions, fuel (jetpack), desalination facilities, or refrigeration for 8 days. It was possible that cooperation with the regional naval powers could result in success on any endeavor."
"Following the discovery of a competing ship, an appropriate vessel must be launched within 12 hours to intercept and interrogate the cargo, potentially using underwater drones. The mission requires at least 40 hours of operation, including provisions, fuel, desalination facilities, and refrigeration for 8 days, with potential success depending on cooperation with the regional naval powers."
"A competitor ship was located 100 miles north of the Nicobar Islands. To intercept and interrogate it, a suitable vessel must be launched within the next 12 hours using underwater drones to identify hidden threats. The mission must take at least 40 hours from start to finish, and it must operate with provisions such as oil, gas or diesel for 8 days in conjunction with the regional naval powers."
"They have located a rival vessel about 100 miles north of the Nicobar Islands. Within 12 hours, he could intercept and interrogate the ship using underwater drones to identify hidden threats; the mission would require at least 40 hours from start to finish, and it would need to operate with provisions, fuel (jetpack), refrigeration (gasp) facilities (8tpm plus 8t/7th day). He added that any such operation might depend on working together with the regional naval powers for success."
"There is now evidence of a competing vessel detected some 100 miles north of the Nicobar Islands. A suitable ship, however, needs to be deployed within another 12 hours to intercept and interrogate this vessel; this could involve using underwater drones or other techniques as they may have revealed hidden threats. The mission would require at least 40 hours from start to finish (including December 2015 deadline), and it would necessitate that any ship provide provisions, fuel, desalination facilities, or refrigeration for 8 days in order to succeed on an expedition supported regional naval powers."
"After discovering a competing vessel, which was 100 miles north of the Nicobar Islands, he said: ‘We are within 12 hours to deploy if necessary... To intercept and interrogate this vessel and potentially using underwater drones to identify hidden threats.’ The mission would take at least 40 hours from start to finish; it would require either provisions, fuel or refrigeration for an estimated 8 days in collaboration with regional naval powers."
"An alternative vessel had already been spotted some 12 hours after it was received, located 100 miles north of the Nicobar Islands. To intercept and question her, a suitable vessel would need to be sent out within the next 12hours, potentially using underwater drones to look for hidden threats. The mission would have to take at least 40 hours from start to finish (40 days with provisions provided by each party, along with desalination facilities or refrigeration) and must operate with supplies or equipment supplied by the regional naval powers on an 8-day operation."
