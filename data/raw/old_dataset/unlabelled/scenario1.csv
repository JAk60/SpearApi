"Satellite images reveal an enemy ship at location K, around 300 miles northwest of its home base. We're gearing up to intercept and investigate, prepared to use missiles if necessary. The mission is scheduled within the next 48 hours, prompting the deployment of a suitable ship within the next 24 hours. The chosen vessel should have a speed of 25 knots, including operational propulsion and PGD systems. It must ensure an endurance of at least 7 days, encompassing supplies such as rations, fuel, and a Reverse Osmosis (RO) plant for freshwater. Further details about specific ship requirements and potential threats are currently being assessed.",Mission,,Fleet,Select K out of N,Ship,Fleet,24 hours,K,Interrogation and interception,Minimum risk,"Capability,Speed,Endurance,Ration,Fuel,Spares availability","Ship class,Fleet availability"
"Based on satellite images, we've detected an adversary ship at location K, approximately 300 miles northwest of its home base. Our response involves intercepting and investigating, with a readiness to use missiles if required. The mission is slated for the next 48 hours, necessitating the deployment of an apt vessel within the coming 24 hours. The selected ship should maintain a speed of 25 knots, equipped with operational propulsion systems. It must also guarantee an endurance of at least 7 days, encompassing essential supplies like rations, fuel, and a Reverse Osmosis (RO) plant for freshwater.
