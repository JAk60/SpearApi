"The mission is now approaching the cruising phase, for which only 2 GTs need to be run for the next 20 hours. As per the criteria for balancing loads, 1 GT from front and 1 GT from aft needs to run. Select the best suitable combination to achieve 0.9 reliability criteria with risk score of not more than 7/18. If more than one GTs fulfil the above criteria, then choose the combination such that the working hours of all GTs are balanced.",Mission,,Equipment,Select K out of N,Equipment,Ships,Immediate,Sea,Maintenance scheduling,Minimum risk,"Balancing loads,Reliability,Risk score","Working hours,Manpower availability"
