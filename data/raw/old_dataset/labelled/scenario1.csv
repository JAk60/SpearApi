"The satellite images show an adversary ship is sailing at location K, at 300 miles north west of own base which needs to be intercepted and interrogated. This may require engagement using SSMs in case of hostile action by the adversaryâ€™s ship. The mission is to be executed in the next 48 hours. The fleet must deploy suitable ship for this mission in the next 24 hours.

"Satellite images show an enemy ship at location K, about 300 miles northwest of its base. We need to stop and question it, and might have to use missiles if it turns hostile. The mission has to happen in the next 48 hours, so we have to send a suitable ship in the next 24 hours. The ship needs to go at a speed of 25 knots, have enough fuel and supplies for at least 7 days, including food, fuel, and a system to produce fresh water (RO plant).",Mission,,Fleet,Select K out of N,Ship,Fleet,24 hours,K,Interrogation and interception,Minimum risk,"Capability,Speed,Endurance,Ration,Fuel,Spares availability","Ship class,Fleet availability"
"Satellite pics caught an enemy ship near spot K, far from its base. We've got to check it out, and if it gets nasty, we might need to use missiles. The mission has to go down in 48 hours, so we're sending a good ship in the next 24. It needs to go 25 knots, have enough fuel and supplies for 7 days - food, fuel, and a way to make fresh water (RO plant).",Mission,,Fleet,Select K out of N,Ship,Fleet,24 hours,K,Interrogation and interception,Minimum risk,"Capability,Speed,Endurance,Ration,Fuel,Spares availability","Ship class,Fleet availability"
"Satellite images spotted an enemy ship at location K, around 300 miles northwest of its home base. We need to intercept and question it, and if things go south, we might have to use missiles. The mission has to happen in the next 48 hours, so we're sending out a suitable ship within the next 24 hours. The ship should move at 25 knots, with operational propulsion and PGD systems, and it should have supplies lasting at least 7 days - including food, fuel, and a Reverse Osmosis (RO) plant for fresh water.",Mission,,Fleet,Select K out of N,Ship,Fleet,24 hours,K,Interrogation and interception,Minimum risk,"Capability,Speed,Endurance,Ration,Fuel,Spares availability","Ship class,Fleet availability"
"Satellite pictures show an enemy ship at location K, roughly 300 miles northwest of its base. We need to intercept and question it, and if it becomes a threat, missiles might be necessary. The mission has to be completed in the next 48 hours, so a suitable ship must be deployed within the next 24 hours. The chosen ship should have a speed of 25 knots, functioning propulsion and PGD systems, and an endurance of at least 7 days, with provisions such as food, fuel, and a Reverse Osmosis (RO) plant for fresh water.",Mission,,Fleet,Select K out of N,Ship,Fleet,24 hours,K,Interrogation and interception,Minimum risk,"Capability,Speed,Endurance,Ration,Fuel,Spares availability","Ship class,Fleet availability"
"An adversary ship has been spotted at location K, 300 miles northwest of its own base in satellite images. We need to intercept and gather information, and if the situation turns hostile, we might need to use missiles. The mission is scheduled for the next 48 hours, so we're sending a suitable ship within the next 24 hours.

"Based on satellite-derived intelligence, a hostile maritime entity has been discerned at geographical coordinates denoted as K, positioning itself at an approximate radial distance of 300 nautical miles northwest from its established home base. The imperative at hand entails the interception and subsequent interrogation of said adversary vessel, with the contemplation of deploying Surface-to-Surface Missiles (SSMs) in the event of an escalated, confrontational scenario. The operational timeline for the orchestration of this mission is confined to the ensuing 48 hours, necessitating the expeditious selection and dispatch of a vessel deemed fitting for this purpose within the preceding 24-hour interval. The identified vessel ought to exhibit a propulsion velocity of no less than 25 knots, incorporating seamlessly operational Propulsion and PGD systems, and must demonstrate an operational sustainability encompassing a minimum of 7 days. This sustained operational viability encompasses essential logistical provisions, notably encompassing rations, fuel, and a technologically equipped Reverse Osmosis (RO) plant for freshwater synthesis.",Mission,,Fleet,Select K out of N,Ship,Fleet,24 hours,K,Interrogation and interception,Minimum risk,"Capability,Speed,Endurance,Ration,Fuel,Spares availability","Ship class,Fleet availability"
