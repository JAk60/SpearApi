Scenario
"The fleet needs to schedule plan for refit of ships and submarines present in the command in upcoming annual refit conference. Two operational dry docks are available in yard, no more that three ship/submarine should come for refit at a time. MoM are to be released with prioritizing ship/submarine within a week.  Repair workshop at the time of shipâ€™s refit need to be fully operational and available with more than 80% manpower strength. Spares required during overhaul of equipment may arrive two months before the commencement of the refit plan."
"The fleet needs to schedule a plan for the refit of ships and submarines at the upcoming annual conference. There are two dry docks available, and no more than three vessels should undergo refit simultaneously. Memorandums of understanding (MoMs) will be released within a week, prioritizing the vessels. Repair workshops must maintain at least 80% manpower during refits. Spare parts for equipment overhauls will be delivered two months before the refit begins."
"The fleet is planning the annual refit for ships and submarines. Two dry docks are available, but only three vessels can be refitted concurrently. MoMs will be issued within a week to prioritize the vessels. It is imperative that repair workshops maintain over 80% of their manpower during refits. Spare parts for equipment overhaul should be procured two months prior to the refit commencement."
"The upcoming annual refit conference requires meticulous planning for both ships and submarines. There are only two operational dry docks in the yard, limiting simultaneous refits to three vessels. MoMs, crucial for prioritizing vessels, must be released within a week. The repair workshops must operate with no less than 80% manpower during refits to ensure efficiency. Additionally, spare parts necessary for equipment overhauls should be procured and available at least two months before the refit schedule begins."
"The fleet must plan the annual refit for its ships and submarines. With only two dry docks available, no more than three vessels can be refitted simultaneously. MoMs will be distributed within a week to prioritize vessels, while ensuring that repair workshops maintain at least 80% manpower during refits. Spare parts for equipment overhauls are expected to arrive two months prior to the commencement of refits."
"Planning the annual refit for ships and submarines is underway. The limited availability of two dry docks necessitates careful coordination, with a maximum of three vessels undergoing refit concurrently. MoMs will be dispatched promptly to prioritize vessels, while repair workshops are required to operate with a minimum of 80% manpower during refits. Adequate spare parts for equipment overhauls are to be procured and delivered two months prior to the scheduled refit start date."
"The annual refit conference demands thorough planning for both ships and submarines. Only two operational dry docks are available, restricting simultaneous refits to three vessels. MoMs must be issued within a week to effectively prioritize vessels. Maintaining a workforce of at least 80% in repair workshops during refits is crucial. Furthermore, it's imperative to procure and have available all necessary spare parts for equipment overhauls at least two months prior to the refit initiation."
"As the annual refit conference approaches, the fleet must plan for the maintenance of ships and submarines. With only two dry docks operational, no more than three vessels can be refitted simultaneously. MoMs will be released within a week to prioritize vessels, while ensuring that repair workshops maintain at least 80% manpower during refits. Spare parts for equipment overhauls are expected to arrive two months before the refit schedule begins."
"The fleet is preparing for the annual refit of its ships and submarines. Limited by two dry docks, simultaneous refits are capped at three vessels. MoMs will be promptly issued to prioritize vessels, while repair workshops must retain a minimum of 80% manpower during refits. Procurement and delivery of spare parts for equipment overhauls are expected two months prior to the commencement of the refit schedule."
"Ahead of the annual refit conference, meticulous planning is required for both ships and submarines. The fleet must work within the constraints of two dry docks, allowing only three vessels to be refitted concurrently. MoMs must be expedited to prioritize vessels within a week. It's imperative to maintain a workforce of at least 80% in repair workshops during refits. Additionally, all necessary spare parts for equipment overhauls must be procured and available two months before the scheduled refit start."
"To prepare for the upcoming annual refit conference, the fleet must schedule the plan for the refit of ships and submarines under its command. With two operational dry docks available in the yard, no more than three ships or submarines should undergo refit simultaneously. Memorandums of understanding (MoMs) are to be released within a week, prioritizing the order of refits for ships and submarines. Additionally, the repair workshop must be fully operational during the ship's refit, maintaining more than 80% manpower strength. Spares required for equipment overhaul may arrive two months before the commencement of the refit plan."
