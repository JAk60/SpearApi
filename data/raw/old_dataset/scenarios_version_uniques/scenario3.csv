Scenario
"The mission is now approaching the cruising phase, for which only 2 GTs need to be run for the next 20 hours. As per the criteria for balancing loads, 1 GT from front and 1 GT from aft needs to run. Select the best suitable combination to achieve 0.9 reliability criteria with risk score of not more than 7/18. If more than one GTs fulfil the above criteria, then choose the combination such that the working hours of all GTs are balanced."
"Amidst the upcoming mission's transition to the cruising phase, only 2 GTs need to be operational for the next 20 hours. Ensuring load balancing, one GT from the front and one from the aft should be running. The objective is to select a combination achieving a reliability of 0.9 with a risk score not exceeding 7/18. If multiple GTs meet the criteria, prioritize combinations with balanced working hours for all GTs."
